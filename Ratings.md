# Ratings

## Battery:

The board is rated for 3-4S and could possibly be modded to reach 5S (for the crazy people).

Up to 80A of current is possible thanks to ultra traces and wide copper pours.

## Regulators

Both the 5V and 9V regulator are capable of up to 3A.

The regulators and associated circuitry surrounding them will get **hot over 2A of current, caution is advised at higher current levels.**  That said, these regulators vastly outpreform all linear regualtors for those looking to fly with higher current accessories such as high brightness LEDs and high power video transmitters.

## LC Filter

LC filter voltage must remain below 12V and under 800 mA.

## Protections

* The on-board regulators are protected from reverse voltage hook-up (oops).
* The on-board regulators have a thermal overload that will shut them down if they are momentarily abused.
